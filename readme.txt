== Description ==

<strong>THE COMPANION WORDPRESS PLUGIN FOR USING STATUS MACHINE</strong><br />

Want to monitor and track your site activity? Find out exactly who does what on your WordPress website. Status Machine is like an airplane's black box that logs every activity in WordPress, and lets you see exactly what people are doing on your site.

* Like, if someone is trying to hack your site.
* Or, exactly when a theme was updated.
* Or, if a plugin was activated/deactivated.

You won't understand how you managed your website without it. Promise.
